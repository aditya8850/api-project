place order.

all the db operation which an ecom app performs to place the order

1. get cart items of the user, and calculate the totalAmount to be charged
2. create a record for the order.
3. reduce the stock(products quantity) || update the inventory
4. clear the cart
if any of these operations failed , we'd like to invalidate the entire steps.
to perform all these operations together as a single unit we have a feature called TRANSACTIONS in mongodb.


5. deduct the payment
6. inform about the order to sellers
7. inform the courrier
